there are 18 different variables, not all are present in every entry. I can only guess at what the abbreviations(?) stand for. I'm calling "i" individual, the user (subject) of an action; and "t" target, the recipient (object) of an action.

Timestamps are given in microseconds, may not be entirely accurate.

name	type	abbreviation best guess
clt	int	combat log type
	Enum type. Corresponds to types of events (regardless of individual/target), not category in combat logs.
	0 = combat (CC), 1 = damage, 2 = healing, 3 = power, 4 = supercharge, 6 = items, 7 = cash, 8 = KO 
itp	int	individual type
	Enum type. 0 = player, 2 = npc, 3 = object
iei	int	individual entity id
inm	char    individual name
ivh	int	individual value health
ivp	int	individual value power
ttp	int	target type
	Enum type. 0 = player, 2 = npc, 3 = object
tdi	int	target damage id
	Only appears under [Damage] or [Combat] categories, when a player attacks a non-player, without necessarily being the same entity.
tei	int	target entity id
tnm	char    target name
tvh	int	target value health
tvp	int	target value power
adi	int	animation_id
anm	char	animation_name
vfi	int	value
	The internal value generated by the action. This may be adjusted before being shown in the combat log's text, e.g. overkill damage is not shown.
ivs	int	individual value supercharge
tvs	int	target value supercharge
idi	int	individual damage id
	Only appears under [Damage] or [Combat] categories, when a non-player attacks a player. Matches a target's display name without necessarily being the same entity (but for players, will always be in 1-1 correspondence with iei).
